# Nimbox

Nimbox is a [Rustbox][rb]-inspired [termbox][tb] wrapper for [Nim][nim].

Nimbox uses an object-oriented style, making writing text-based user
interfaces easy and intuitive.

Nimbox is still in development and may eat your laundry. **You have been
warned.**

## Installation

Nimbox is currently not in the Nimble package repository, so you have to
install it via Git:

```shell
git clone https://notabug.org/vktec/nimbox.git
cd nimbox
nimble install
```
