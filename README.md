# Nimbox

Nimbox is a [Rustbox][rb]-inspired [termbox][tb] wrapper for [Nim][nim].

Nimbox uses an object-oriented style, making writing text-based user
interfaces easy and intuitive.

Nimbox is still in development and may eat your laundry. **You have been
warned.**

## Installation

Nimbox can be installed through [Nimble][nimble], Nim's package manager:

```shell
nimble install nimbox
```
